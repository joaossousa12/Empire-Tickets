## Description

Empire tickets is a ticket based website built in php using css, javascript, ajax, etc with a star wars theme, where a user can create tickets and the agents/admins will handle them.
The agents can choose a ticket on their department so they can report to the client needs. The admins are also agents and they can control the whole site, they can change users 
roles, switch between an admin view and agent view, create new departments/hashtags/statuses, etc.

## Create the database 

To create the database, we need to run the following command:

    sqlite3 database.db < database.sql

## Open on browser

Go to the Empire Tickets directory on your machine, open the terminal and type:

    php -S localhost:9000
